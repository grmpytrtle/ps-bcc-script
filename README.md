# **Browser Cache and Cookies Cleaner Script**

### Overview

This PowerShell script is designed to manage browser data for all user profiles on a Windows system. It provides functionality for backing up browsing history and clearing cache, cookies, and temporary files for popular browsers, including Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Internet Explorer/Microsoft Edge.

<br/>

## Features

### 1. User Profile Management

- Automatically gathers a list of user profiles from the C:\Users directory.
- Exports the user list to a CSV file (bcc-users.csv) for batch processing.

### 2. Backup Browsing History

- Creates backups of browsing history for:
   - Mozilla Firefox
   - Google Chrome
   - Microsoft Edge
- Stores backups in a centralized directory: C:\Support\BrowserHistoryBackup.

### 3. Clear Browser Data

Deletes cache, cookies, and temporary files for each user on the system:
   - Firefox: Clears cache, cookies, thumbnails, and SQLite storage files.
   - Chrome: Clears cache, cookies, media cache, and session files.
   - Edge/Internet Explorer: Clears temporary internet files, error reporting data, temp directories, Windows temp files, and recycle bin contents.

### 4. Error Handling and Logging

- Provides detailed output for each operation, including successful deletions and errors encountered during execution.

### 5. Modular Design

- The script processes data for all user profiles, making it suitable for systems with multiple users.
